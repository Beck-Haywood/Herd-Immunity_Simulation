1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
    Here is an example of the input to run the simulation: python3 simulation.py Rabies 0.014 0.999999 1000 .01 55
    The first input is the name of the virus: Rabies
    The second input rate is the reproductive rate, which is very low 1.4% because Rabies requires the subject come in contact with saliva to contract it.
    Third input is mortality rate which is very high, if not vaccinated, there is only one person on record that survived it without a vacination
    Fourth input is the population of the simulation which is 1000
    Next is the percentage vaccinated which is 1%
    Finally the last input is initial infected, which if left blank will assume 1
